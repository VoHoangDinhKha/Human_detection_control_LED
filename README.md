The project aims to develop a highly accurate and responsive human detection camera system, combined with a flexible and automatic lighting control system. The goal is to use data from the IP Camera to analyze images and recognize humans. This analysis will then be used to control the lighting in the monitored area. The project employs technologies and methods such as image classification, light signal processing, and position control algorithms to achieve this goal.
